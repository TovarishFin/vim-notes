# VIM NOTES

## jumping around edits

`g;` moves back to last edit
`g,` moves to next edit

`:changes` will list out all changes

## jumping around jumps... heh
`<C> o` will jump to last jump
`<C> i` will jump to next jump

## other things that i keep forgetting
`C` for change whole line from cursor
`s` for deleting and going into insert mode (xi in one key)
`S` OR `cc` to dchange whole line
`I` start in insert mode at start of text on line (good for indented stuff!)

## cool info on leader key
This is something that is meant to be a namespaced area for own key bindings!!! check this out and start customizing stuff!!!
especially stuff like `ALEFix` etc....
